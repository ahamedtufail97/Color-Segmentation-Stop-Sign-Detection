# Color-Segmentation for Stop-Sign-Detection

The aim of this project is to do color segmentation
(red). I use logistic regression machine learning model to train
the hand-labelled images to classify red and not red, and then
implement a stop sign detector to detect stop sign in the images
given. I use various high-level features such as number of sides
of the polygon and shape statistics such as Bounding box area
to image area ratio and width to height ratios to improve
detection. The effectiveness of the methods used are observed
by experimentation, discussed and the results are presented.
